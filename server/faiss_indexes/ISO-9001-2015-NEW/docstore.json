terminology\nThe clause structure (i.e. clause sequence) and some of the terminology of this edition of this \nInternational Standard, in comparison with the previous edition (ISO\n \n9001:2008), have been changed \nto improve alignment with other management systems standards.\nThere is no requirement in this International Standard for its structure and terminology to be applied \nto the documented information of an organization\u2019s quality management system.\nThe structure of clauses is intended to provide a coherent presentation of requirements, rather than a \nmodel for documenting an organization\u2019s policies, objectives and processes. The structure and content \nof documented information related to a quality management system can often be more relevant to its \nusers if it relates to both the processes operated by the organization and information maintained for \nother purposes.\nThere is no requirement for the terms used by an organization to be replaced by the terms used in this \nInternational Standard to specify quality management system requirements. Organizations can choose \nto use terms which suit their operations (e.g. using \u201crecords\u201d, \u201cdocumentation\u201d or \u201cprotocols\u201d rather \nthan \u201cdocumented information\u201d; or \u201csupplier\u201d, \u201cpartner\u201d or \u201cvendor\u201d rather than \u201cexternal provider\u201d). \nTable\n A\n.1 shows the major differences in terminology between this edition of this International \nStandard and the previous edition.\nTable\n \nA.1\n \n\u2014 Major differences in terminology between ISO\n \n9001:2008 and ISO\n \n9001:2015\nISO 9001:2008 ISO 9001:2015\nProducts Products and services\nExclusions Not used\n(See Clause \nA.5 for clarification of applicability)\nManagement representative Not used\n(Similar responsibilities and authorities are assigned \nbut no requirement for a single management repre-\nsentative)\nDocumentation, quality manual, documented pro -\ncedures, records\nDocumented information\nWork environment Environment for the operation of processes\nMonitoring and measuring equipment Monitoring and measuring resources\nPurchased product Externally provided products and services\nSupplier External provider\nA.2 Pr oducts and services\nISO 9001:2008 used the term \u201cproduct\u201d to include all output categories.

The characteristic of services is that at least part of \nthe output is realized at the interface with the customer. This means, for example, that conformity to \nrequirements cannot necessarily be confirmed before service delivery.\nIn most cases, products and services are used together. Most outputs that organizations provide to \ncustomers, or are supplied to them by external providers, include both products and services. For \nexample, a tangible or intangible product can have some associated service or a service can have some \nassociated tangible or intangible product.\nA.3 Understanding the needs and e xpectations of interested parties\nSubclause 4.2  specifies requirements for the organization to determine the interested parties that \nare relevant to the quality management system and the requirements of those interested parties. \nHowever, 4.2 does not imply extension of quality management system requirements beyond the scope \nof this International Standard. As stated in the scope, this International Standard is applicable where \nan organization needs to demonstrate its ability to consistently provide products and services that \nmeet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, and aims to enhance customer \nsatisfaction.\nThere is no requirement in this International Standard for the organization to consider interested \nparties where it has decided that those parties are not relevant to its quality management system. It is \nfor the organization to decide if a particular requirement of a relevant interested party is relevant to its \nquality management system.\nA.4 Risk -based thinking\nThe concept of risk-based thinking has been implicit in previous editions of this International Standard, \ne.g. through requirements for planning, review and improvement. This International Standard \nspecifies requirements for the organization to understand its context (see 4.1) and determine risks as \na basis for planning (see 6.1). This represents the application of risk-based thinking to planning and \nimplementing quality management system processes (see 4.4) and will assist in determining the extent \nof documented information.\nOne of the key purposes of a quality management system is to act as a preventive tool. Consequently, \nthis International Standard does not have a separate clause or subclause on preventive action. The \nconcept of preventive action is expressed through the use of risk-based thinking in formulating quality \nmanagement system requirements.\nThe risk-based thinking applied in this International Standard has enabled some reduction in \nprescriptive requirements and their replacement by performance-based requirements. There is greater \nflexibility than in ISO\n 9\n001:2008 in the requirements for processes, documented information and \norganizational responsibilities.\nAlthough 6.1 specifies that the organization shall plan actions to address risks, there is no requirement \nfor formal methods for risk management or a documented risk management process. Organizations can \ndecide whether or not to develop a more extensive risk management methodology than is required by \nthis International Standard, e.g. through the application of other guidance or standards.\nNot all the processes of a quality management system represent the same level of risk in terms of the \norganization\u2019s ability to meet its objectives, and the effects of uncertainty are not the same for all \norganizations. Under the requirements of 6.1 , the organization is responsible for its application of risk-\nbased thinking and the actions it takes to address risk, including whether or not to retain documented \ninformation as evidence of its determination of risks.\n \n22 \u00a9 ISO 2015 \u2013 All rights reserved\n--`,````,`,```,,`,,```,,,,``,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 3952, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74efb873-ba47-414f-a1bf-6ac9acd036ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "74efb873-ba47-414f-a1bf-6ac9acd036ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "tmpbd9n0kfh.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\LY7CD6~1.HOA\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpbd9n0kfh.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 321866, "creation_date": "2025-07-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc5d270c-ae60-4038-b612-4e0e074f1719", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "tmpbd9n0kfh.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\LY7CD6~1.HOA\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpbd9n0kfh.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 321866, "creation_date": "2025-07-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-22"}, "hash": "9a7acc852fa62af6f120fa22931c3710dc24a00e0cb00b74ce8b85f36c935cd0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "ISO 9001:2015(E)\nA.5 Applicability\nThis International Standard does not refer to \u201cexclusions\u201d in relation to the applicability of its \nrequirements to the organization\u2019s quality management system. However, an organization can review \nthe applicability of requirements due to the size or complexity of the organization, the management \nmodel it adopts, the range of the organization\u2019s activities and the nature of the risks and opportunities \nit encounters.\nThe requirements for applicability are addressed in 4.3, which defines conditions under which an \norganization can decide that a requirement cannot be applied to any of the processes within the scope \nof its quality management system. The organization can only decide that a requirement is not applicable \nif its decision will not result in failure to achieve conformity of products and services.\nA.6 Document ed information\nAs part of the alignment with other management system standards, a common clause on \u201cdocumented \ninformation\u201d has been adopted without significant change or addition (see 7. 5). Where appropriate, \ntext elsewhere in this International Standard has been aligned with its requirements. Consequently, \n\u201cdocumented information\u201d is used for all document requirements.\nWhere ISO\n 9\n001:2008 used specific terminology such as \u201cdocument\u201d or \u201cdocumented procedures\u201d, \n\u201cquality manual\u201d or \u201cquality plan\u201d, this edition of this International Standard defines requirements to \n\u201cmaintain documented information\u201d.\nWhere ISO\n \n9001:2008 used the term \u201crecords\u201d to denote documents needed to provide evidence \nof conformity with requirements, this is now expressed as a requirement to \u201cretain documented \ninformation\u201d. The organization is responsible for determining what documented information needs to \nbe retained, the period of time for which it is to be retained and the media to be used for its retention.\nA requirement to \u201cmaintain\u201d documented information does not exclude the possibility that the \norganization might also need to \u201cretain\u201d that same documented information for a particular purpose, \ne.g. to retain previous versions of it.\nWhere this International Standard refers to \u201cinformation\u201d rather than \u201cdocumented information\u201d (e.g. in \n4.1: \u201cThe organization shall monitor and review the information about these external and internal issues\u201d), \nthere is no requirement that this information is to be documented. In such situations, the organization \ncan decide whether or not it is necessary or appropriate to maintain documented information.\nA.7 Or ganizational knowledge\nIn 7.1.6, this International Standard addresses the need to determine and manage the knowledge \nmaintained by the organization, to ensure the operation of its processes and that it can achieve \nconformity of products and services.\nRequirements regarding organizational knowledge were introduced for the purpose of:\na)\n s\nafeguarding the organization from loss of knowledge, e.g.\n\u2014\n t\nhrough staff turnover;\n\u2014\n f\nailure to capture and share information;\nb)\n e\nncouraging the organization to acquire knowledge, e.g.\n\u2014\n l\nearning from experience;\n\u2014 me\nntoring;\n\u2014\n b\nenchmarking.\n \n\u00a9 ISO 2015 \u2013 All rights reserved 23\n--`,````,`,```,,`,,```,,,,``,-`-`,,`,,`,`,,`---", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 3217, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "743f3904-edbf-4020-a004-cf0e5237c50a": {"__data__": {"id_": "743f3904-edbf-4020-a004-cf0e5237c50a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "tmpbd9n0kfh.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\LY7CD6~1.HOA\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpbd9n0kfh.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 321866, "creation_date": "2025-07-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-22"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83fcbee7-6d23-438f-8c36-d2ff0623c721", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "tmpbd9n0kfh.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\LY7CD6~1.HOA\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmpbd9n0kfh.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 321866, "creation_date": "2025-07-22", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-22"}, "hash": "ae0025acbfbc79a8794a525ecce65d1aad938714342278b77eeba867424e58bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "ISO 9001:2015(E)\nA.8\t Control\tof\texternally\tprovided\tprocesses,\tproducts\tand\tservices\nAll forms of externally provided processes, products and services are addressed in 8.4, e.g. whether \nthrough:\na)\n p\nurchasing from a supplier;\nb)\n a\nn arrangement with an associate company;\nc)\n o\nutsourcing processes to an external provider.\nOutsourcing always has the essential characteristic of a service, since it will have at least one activity \nnecessarily performed at the interface between the provider and the organization.\nThe controls required for external provision can vary widely depending on the nature of the processes, \nproducts and services.
